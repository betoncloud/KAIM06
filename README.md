# Python Script for Data Processing and Logging

This Python script performs initial data processing tasks, including the configuration of logging, handling warnings, and adding the parent directory to the Python path. It is designed to set up a foundation for further data analysis or processing workflows by ensuring that the necessary configurations are in place before any other code runs.

## Features

- **Logging Configuration**: Sets up logging to capture relevant information and warnings throughout the execution of the script.
- **Warning Filtering**: Suppresses warnings to reduce noise in output, particularly useful during exploratory or experimental stages.
- **Dynamic Python Path Setup**: Automatically adds the parent directory to the Python path, making it easier to import modules from higher-level directories.
- **Data Handling Setup**: Prepares the environment for further data manipulation with libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `numpy` library

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
